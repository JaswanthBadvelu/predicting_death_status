# COVID 19 Detailed Analysis
The total number of deaths due to COVID 19 crossed 100K mark on 26th May in the USA. With the daily increase in COVID-19 and limited hospital capacity, it is extremely difficult for healthcare workers to monitor all the people who tested positive for COVID 19 since the fatality rate is less than 10% in most of the countries. An article published by CNBC states that a significant number of states lack enough ICU beds in their hospitals to deal with the projected wave of COVID 19 cases. However, Since most of the countries are updating data related to COVID 19 daily. With the advancement in machine learning using historical data, it is easy to predict which people are at risk due to COVID 19. 

If we can accurately predict for all the people infected with COVID 19 whether the patient is going to die or not. Then the patient can be given more priority and can be monitored continuously to prevent the patient from dying.
